------------------------------------------- LINUX -------------------------------------------

Free OS, Secure, contains many distributions, fast.

Kernel:    CPU | RAM | I/O
    1. Device management
    2. Memory management
    3. Process management
    4. Handling system calls

Linux Commands : 

pwd -> present working directory
ls -> list of all files and folders in present working directory
cd -> change directory
cd .. -> go to previous directory
ls -ltr -> list all the files and folders in present working directory along with their name, size, permissions, timestamp when it is created.
touch <filename> -> creates a file with given file name.
vi <filename> -> creates(if not present) and opens a file with given file name.
cat <filename> - >displays all the content present in the file mentioned.
nproc -> gives number of CPU's in the instance.
free -> gives disk space used and available.
df -> prints the disk space.
man <Command_name> -> gives the manual/guide for the mentioned Command.
top -> used to manage the memory, CPU or look into the details.


------------------------------------------- Shell Scripting -------------------------------------------

#!/bin/?  -> Starting line of every shell script

? - bash/dash/sh/ksh
But mostly we use "bash".

So, 1st line in every shell script is "#!/bin/bash".


Steps to create and run the shell scripts : 

    1. vi helloWorld.sh -> creates and opens helloWorld.sh file
    2. press "esc" and then "i" to enter into insert mode to write script in the file.
    3. Write the code. For example
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Hello World"
*** 4. Now, to save the script and exit from the file, we have to press "esc" and then ":wq!".
    5. To execute the helloWorld.sh file we have 2 methods.
        a. sh helloWorld.sh
        b. ./helloWorld.sh


chmod -> command used to grant permissions to files.

"chmod abc <fileName>"

a -> user   |   b -> group   |  c -> other users.

4 - to grant "Read" permissions
2 - to grant "Write" permissions
1 - to grant "Execute" permissions.


Example: 

chmod 777 helloWorld.sh -> command to grant all read, write and execute permissions to user, group and other users.

More commands:

history -> gives history of all commands that you used in past.
mkdir <folderName> -> used to create a folder with given name in present working directory.



Imp commands used in shell scripting : 


1. set -x   ->  debug mode  -> gives which output belongs to which command.

2. grep and awk

    lets take a script.sh file which contains content as below

        My name is Sai
        I am from Anantapur
    
    grep name script.sh -> this command gives the lines in script.sh which contains the word "name" in it.
                        ->  output : My name is Sai

    grep name script.sh | awk -F" " '{print : $4}' -> first, from grep command, we get "My name is Sai." as output.
                                                   -> from that output, using "awk" command we will 4th value as output.
                                                   -> -F" " -> in double quotes, we have to specify the field seperator.
                                                            -> this will give 4 values(My, name, is, Sai)
                                                   -> {print : $4} -> prints the 4th value as output.
                                                   -> Output : Sai


3. When you are using '|' in script, it is best to insluce the below commands at Startingof the script.

    a. set -e            ->  used to exit the script when there is error. But the drawback is, it won't catch pipefailures.
    b. set -0 pipefail   ->  used to catch pipefailures.

4. wget <url to file location>   ->  when the file is in cloud(like s3 bucket or blob storage or etc), it will "download" the content in the url as a log file(.log format) into the present working directory.

5. curl <url to file location>   -> when the file is in cloud(like s3 bucket or blob storage or etc), we use this command to "display" the content in the file using the url given.

6. find

    -> To get into the root user directory, we use "sudo su -" command. sudo means "Substitute User Do" and su means "Switch User".
    -> If we want to search a file(we don't know where it is), we first have to got he root user directory and run the below command.
            find / -name <fileName>
                where "/" means "search from all"
    -> We can use below command to find a file from present working directory
            sudo find / -name <fileName>




-> If-else and for loop in Shell scripting :

    syntax:  

                    if [expression]
                    then
                        <Do this>
                    else
                        <Do this>
                    fi

    example:

        a=10
        b=20

        if [a -gt b]
        then
            echo "a is greater than b"
        else
            echo "b is greater than a"
        fi


    syntax:

                for i in {1.100};do echo $1;done


-> Trap command: 

    used to trap signal in Linux.

    syntax: trap <prompt to display> <signal_name>

    Example: trap "Do not use ctrl+c" SIGINT

            SIGINT -> signal interept.

            To know about various signal names, explore in internet.


-> To parse the json file that is displayed in output, we have to use "jq" command. 
   To parse the json file that is displayed in output, we have to use "yq" command.

   Example : 
        aws e2 describe-instances | jq '.Response[].Instances[].InstanseId'
